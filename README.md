# 🧮 Scientific Calculator

Welcome to my **Scientific Calculator** project! 🎉 This was my very first script written in **2020**, and I'm excited to share it with you. It’s a simple yet powerful web-based calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations as well as some scientific functions. 🚀

## ✨ Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` ➗
- Advanced functions: `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `log()`, `√`, `x²` 🔥
- PI constant (π) included 🌍
- Clean, responsive design for mobile and desktop devices 📱💻

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – For the structure of the calculator
- **CSS** – For styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript** – For the calculator's logic and functionality
- No frameworks used, just pure vanilla code 💡
